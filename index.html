			<h1>Dr. APJ ABDUL KALAM</h1>
			<h3>(October 15, 1931-July 27, 2015)</h3>
		  <p>I ADMIRE THIS CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY WHO STARTED CBSE SCHOOLS AND COMPUTER EDUCATION EVEN IN REMOTE VILLAGES BEFORE FOUR DECADES. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS BLESSED PRIEST WILL BE KNOWN AS A MARK OF PEACE BECAUSE IT WAS HE WHO ESTABLISHED A CHURCH AT NILACKAL FOR THE VARIOUS CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS. HIS EFFORTS IN THE SPHERE OF RELIGIOUS HARMONY ARE PRAISEWORTHY.
